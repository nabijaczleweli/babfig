Chronologically: usr-local-libexec-dkms-sign-helper: March 2021
       broken by https://bugs.debian.org/1023029
   replaced with etc-dkms-framework.conf.d-get-pin.conf: October 2022
       broken by environment filtering in recent DKMSes
   replaced with usr-local-libexec-dkms-sign-file: February 2023

See setup.openssl for the setup, it's relatively sane and only needs to read in the passphrase for sign-file.

   Replaced with usr-local-libexec-dkms-sign-file-nss: April 2023

See setup.nss; broader, less sane, setup, but it does use the NSS cert store.
Needs libnss-tools with https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D174327 and its children.
